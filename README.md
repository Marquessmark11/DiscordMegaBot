# Discord Mega Bot
It is a bot that was designed as a rewrite of another bot I made that never really saw the light of day, but now its cool, tons of commands, and useful in some cases.

# Installation

Click "Download Zip" from the `main` branch to download it, extract the file you get.

Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the folder you extracted

And then edit `properties.py` to contain your bots details, and then click `bot.py` to start it.
